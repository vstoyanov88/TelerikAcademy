//Define abstract class Shape with only one abstract method CalculateSurface() and fields width and height. 
//Define two new classes Triangle and Rectangle that implement the virtual method and return the surface 
//of the figure (height*width for rectangle and height*width/2 for triangle). Define class Circle and
//suitable constructor so that at initialization height must be kept equal to width and implement 
//the CalculateSurface() method. Write a program that tests the behavior of  the CalculateSurface() method 
//for different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) stored in an array.
